Ciao!

I am a curious computational chemist, geek, and avid runner. My interest for Science is wide but I am naturaly keen toward the neurosciences in general. Profesionaly wise, I have a deep enthousiam for drug discovey and all associated (computational) techniques.

I was formaly trained to ligand-based approcheases through machine learning and Chemoinformatics but I am currently following the hype for deep learning. During my PhD training and postdoc, I eventually poursuit Molecular Dynamics expertise, notably to examin protein function, and allosteric modulation by small-molecules. Specificaly, I taught myslef to computational electrophysiology for probing function in ion channel structures. From that time, I got addicted to brain receptors structural and functional characterization.

On my free time I mostly train for any kind of long distance running. The (few) snowy winters I practice snowboard touring, and otherwise I play some video games (competitively).
